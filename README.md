## Gameplay
You are the white snow ball in the center of the screen. Use your mouse to point in the direction you want to move.

Your objective is to gain mass by eating the static colored snowflakes and other players / snowballs. Snowflakes re-spawn
 every time a player eats it. As you gain more snow mass the slower you will move.

Other players are moving snowballs of various sizes. You can only consume other players that are smaller than you, 
and larger players will consume you. Be careful and survive as long as possible!

#### Game play Rules
- Players who haven't eaten snowflakes yet cannot be eaten
- Every time a player joins the game, **3** snowflakes will spawn
- Every time a snowflake is eaten by a player, **1** new snowflake will respawn
- The more snowflakes you eat, the slower you move.
